We would like you to:

1)Parse the attached LDIF file,
2)Convert its content into JSON format, and
3)Display it in graph format
###Where the nodes should be expandable and collapsible based on whether they have children nodes###

Use:
nodeJS as the backend processing layer where LDIF can be converted into JSON.
The path where to read the LDIF file should be configurable.
The JSON should comply with D3JS graph format so that the d3js library can render the graph in the UI.
Once the initial rendering of the graph is done, introduce AngularJS 5 to be the MVC framework for project.

Upload your solution to a github repository so we could take a look at it.
The assignment is due to next Monday morning.
Feel to ask any question or other details.
